    Testing of the priority queue ADT
    - The priority queue ADT will use my dataNode type that I am using in my Todo List Manager.

    INPUT:
        MENU:
        - The menu will reject any inupt that is not an integer from 1 to 3.
        - The buffer for the input is 20 characters so for every multiple of 20 characters extra the menu will print an extra time.
        - Numbers input as a double "123.123" will not be accepted as input.

        ADD:
        - The user is expected to follow the instructions printed to the screen and input a line such as "assignment_3 90", which is the activity followed by a string, followed by the priority.
        - If no priority is entered, it will be made 100 by default.
        - If extra tokens are added, they will be removed.
        - If the user adds a non-numerical character in their priority, the priority will be set to 100.
        - If the user enters a negative priority, the priority will be set to 100.

    PRIORITY QUEUE:
        Adding
            - We can see adding is working correctly by adding activities to the list, so I will go ahead and start my todo list.

             <<< Priority Queue Test Program >>>
            [1] Add
            [2] Remove
            [3] Quit
             > 1
            Enter an activity and its priority.
             > watch_starwars 30
              Current List :
                 PRIORITY | ACTIVITY
                       30 | watch_starwars
            [1] Add
            [2] Remove
            [3] Quit

            - We can see it entered correctly, lets add an item with no priority,

            Enter an activity and its priority.
             > assignment_3_2520
              Current List :
                 PRIORITY | ACTIVITY
                       30 | watch_starwars
                      100 | assignment_3_2520

            - It was correctly added as 100, lets make sure it is adding in the correct order (I will exclude the menu).

            Enter an activity and its priority.
             > eat_doritos 1
             > fight_lions 32
             > heal_wounds 34
             > find_crossbow 31

             Current List :
                PRIORITY | ACTIVITY
                       1 | eat_doritos
                      30 | watch_starwars
                      31 | find_crossbow
                      32 | fight_lions
                      34 | heal_wounds
                     100 | assignment_3_2520

            - Its all in the proper order.

            - Lets make a remove,
             Current List :
                PRIORITY | ACTIVITY
                      30 | watch_starwars
                      31 | find_crossbow
                      32 | fight_lions
                      34 | heal_wounds
                     100 | assignment_3_2520

            - We have successfully removed "1 | eat_doritos". A few more removes leaves us with:
             Current List :
                PRIORITY | ACTIVITY
                      32 | fight_lions
                      34 | heal_wounds
                     100 | assignment_3_2520

            - That worked, now lets remove everything.
             Current List :
                PRIORITY | ACTIVITY
                List is Empty!

            - Enter 3 and we quit the menu.
