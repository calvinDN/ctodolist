    Testing of the balancedTree ADT
    - For simplicity of testing my tree will only deal with integers.

    INPUT:
        MENU:
        - The menu will reject any inupt that is not an integer from 1 to 9.
        - The buffer for the input is 20 characters so for every multiple of 20 characters extra the menu will print an extra time.
        - Numbers input as a double "123.123" will not be accepted as input.
        - min node, max node and get height will segfault if selected on an empty tree.

        ADD:
        - Positive integers will be accepted only, any strings containing characters will be rejected, newline characters only will be rejected.
        - If a string is rejected a notice will be printed and you will be returned to the main menu.
        - Large intergers, around 2^32 will be too large and the resulting integer will be an undefined number.
        - Negative values will not be accepted.

    TREE:

        Adding
            - As we go through the testing I will be providing the max node, min node and height so we can see them working as we go along.
            - We can see that adding to the tree is working by adding some integers to the tree:
                  Current List :
                            1
                            2
                            3
            - We can see that numbers are being added, lets ensure they are making something that looks like a tree.
                        1
                    2
                        3
                    min Node: 1
                    max Node: 3
                      Height: 2
            - Looks good, lets add a few more to one side to check if balancing is working,
                            1
                        2
                            3
                    4
                        5
                            6
                    min Node: 1
                    max Node: 6
                      Height: 3
            - Lets add some more,
                            1
                        2
                            3
                    4
                                5
                            6
                                7
                        8
                            9
                               10
                    min Node: 1
                    max Node: 10
                      Height: 4
            - Looks good and the tree rotations have all been correct as done by hand and verified with the java applet for avl trees at:
            http://people.ksp.sk/~kuko/bak/

            - We may now remove all the nodes from the list and we will find remove on an empty list will have no effect.
            - The nodes will be removed in order of the smallest node first.
            - Enter 9 and we quit the menu.
